# Intro 
This is the implementation of the Blocked-Collapsed Gibbs Sampling for **Bayesian Wasserstein Repulsive Gaussian Mixture Models**. 

## Set up the package
Open a Julia REPL and enter the package mode (type in ```]``` and then ```\tab```).
Then we should be able to type in ```dev .``` and press the enter key. 
The REPL windown may look like:
```
(@JuliaVersion) pkg> dev. 
```

## Run the code
The command line examples for launching an experiment are placed in the shell files within the **script** folder.

A quick launch could be 
```
sh scripts/run_sim1.sh
```
